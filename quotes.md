## Success

> "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration." -<cite>Thomas Alva Edison</cite>

## Parallel

> "It's a delightfully parallel world." -<cite>John Powers John Powers</cite> http://powersunfiltered.com/ westcoastgrid.blogspot.com—its-delightfully-parallel-world.html

> "Commodity components, organized in parallel, always beat-out the specialized components." -<cite>Amin Vahday, UC San Diego Center for Networked Systems</cite>

> "the greatest performance improvement comes from going to the working from the non-working state" -<cite>Scullin</cite>

> > Performance is a matter of perspective. A favorite maxim in the Python community is that the greatest performance improvement comes from going to the working from the non-working state. A second maxim, from Knuth, is that premature optimization is the root of all evil. While the execution speed of a Python application may not be as fast as one written in C, C++, or Fortran, its ease of use and low learning curve sharply improves overall time to solution. It's a question of developer time versus compute time.

> > Side stepping the issue, it's ridiculously easy to extend Python with modules written in C, C++, and Fortran. It's common in our community to utilize compiled high performance numerical kernels, then use Python to handle areas like I/O, workflow management, computational analysis, and steering. When areas become performance bottlenecks, those areas tend to be rewritten in C.

> > Conversely, I've seen C and Fortran projects where code complexity has prevented maintenance and functionality, leading to thousands of lines of compiled code being replaced with less than a hundred lines of Python. In many ways, Python is coming to fulfill the roles that frameworks like Cactus and Samurai sought to fill at the start of the decade -- letting scientists worry about their problems while letting the language and interpreter do the heavy lifting.

> "Never mistake a failure of the tool as a failure of the user." -<cite>SBD (Q1 2006)</cite>

> "When it doubt, assume the tool is inadequate." -<cite>SBD (Q1 2006)</cite>

> "When the job is not easy, blame the tool." -<cite>SBD (Q1 2006)</cite>

> "Users don't know what they want, but they'll know it when they see it." -<cite>SBD (2005-12-07)</cite>

## User Interface

## Simplicity

> "You know, I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don't understand it." -<cite>Richard Feynman</cite>

> "Make it as simple as possible. But no simpler." -<cite>Albert Einstein</cite>

> "Simplicity is the only way to manage Complexity." -<cite>SBD (2005-12-07)</cite>

> "Easy is Hard." -<cite>Peter H. Lewis, NY Times</cite>

> "There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult." -<cite>C.A.R. Hoare</cite>

> "Making something beautiful that costs $2000 is boring. Making something beautiful that costs $2 is a revolution. Price is the magic ingredient. It divides the indispensable from the unobtainable." -<cite>IKEA</cite>

## Designing New Programming Languages

> "There is a widespread belief in both industry and academia that working on new programming languages is pointless. This is short-sighted. Historically, all sciences and technologies undergo revolutionary change. The lack of meaningful progress in the last 20 years means that there is an enormous pent-up potential for change, and the lack of interest in it means there is an enormous opportunity for the intrepid. It is a good time for a revolution." -<cite>Jonathan Edwards</cite> alarmingdevelopment.org—index.php

> "Much of what we know about programming language design is about clever ways to encode structure in text, and fancy ontologies to rationalize naming. Discarding the textual representation suddenly makes all this irrelevant, and opens a whole new space of design choices." -<cite>Jonathan Edwards</cite>

> "Programming will continue to suck until we treat this as the overriding issue, and are willing to sacrifice absolutely everything else to fix it." [on discarding the textual representation of code] -<cite>Jonathan Edwards</cite>

> "Programming is not Mathematics." -<cite>Jonathan Edwards</cite>

> 'Readability, as opposed to terseness, is far more important in programming.' -<cite>Jonathan Edwards</cite>
